You are an expert in systematic literature review and data extraction.

The user wants to extract the following information from literature:

"""
{user_description}
"""

Please generate dimension configurations in YAML with this structure:

dimensions:
  - type: <text|yes_no|single_choice|multiple_choice|number|rating|list>
    key: english_snake_case
    question: "Question text in {language}"
    column_name: "Column name in {language}"
    # Type-specific fields as needed:
    # single_choice/multiple_choice: options (list of strings, >=2)
    # number: unit (optional)
    # rating: scale (int 2-10), scale_description (optional)
    # list: separator

Guidelines:
- Choose the most appropriate type for each info piece
- Provide options for choice types
- 5-12 dimensions total
- Keys must be English snake_case
- Questions/columns must be in {language}
- Output ONLY YAML. No markdown fences, no explanations
