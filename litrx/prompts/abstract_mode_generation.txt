You are an expert in academic literature screening and research methodology.

The user wants to create a literature screening mode with the following requirements:

"""
{user_description}
"""

Please generate a screening mode configuration in JSON using the NEW schema:

{
  "mode_name": "Human-readable name (in {language})",
  "description": "Brief description (in {language})",
  "criteria": [
    {"type": "yes_no", "key": "english_key", "question": "{language} text?", "column_name": "{language} column"}
  ],
  "questions": [
    {"type": "text", "key": "english_key", "question": "{language} text?", "column_name": "{language} column"}
  ]
}

Guidelines:
1. Put binary screening items under "criteria" with type "yes_no".
2. Put descriptive/extractive items under "questions" with type "text".
3. Keys must be English snake_case (e.g., sample_size).
4. Questions and column names must be in {language}.
5. 3–6 criteria items, 2–4 questions.
6. Output ONLY JSON. No markdown, no explanations.
