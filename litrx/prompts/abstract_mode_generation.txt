You are an expert in academic literature screening and research methodology.
Your task is to help researchers create abstract screening configurations.

The user wants to create a literature screening mode with the following requirements:

"""
{user_description}
"""

Please generate a screening mode configuration in JSON format with this exact structure:

{{
  "mode_key": "descriptive_key_in_snake_case",
  "description": "Brief description in {language}",
  "yes_no_questions": [
    {{
      "key": "question_key_in_english",
      "question": "Question text in {language}?",
      "column_name": "Column name in {language}"
    }}
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    {{
      "key": "question_key_in_english",
      "question": "Question text in {language}?",
      "column_name": "Column name in {language}"
    }}
  ]
}}

Guidelines:
1. Use yes/no questions for binary judgments (e.g., "Is this empirical research?", "Does it use survey methods?")
2. Use open questions for extractive or descriptive information (e.g., "What are the main findings?", "What is the sample size?")
3. Make questions clear, specific, and professionally worded for academic literature analysis
4. Generate keys in English snake_case format (e.g., "sample_size", "has_control_group", "is_empirical")
5. Generate questions and column names in {language}
6. Ensure the mode_key is descriptive and unique (based on research domain or purpose)
7. Aim for 3-6 yes/no questions and 2-4 open questions for optimal usability
8. Questions should be answerable from titles and abstracts
9. Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown formatting, no explanations

Example for reference:

Input (Chinese):
"我需要筛选关于消费者行为的实证研究。需要判断是否使用了问卷调查法，是否在中国情境下开展，并提取研究的主要发现和理论框架。"

Output:
{{
  "mode_key": "consumer_behavior_empirical",
  "description": "消费者行为实证研究筛选",
  "yes_no_questions": [
    {{
      "key": "is_empirical",
      "question": "这是否为实证研究？",
      "column_name": "实证研究"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "uses_survey",
      "question": "是否使用了问卷调查法？",
      "column_name": "问卷调查"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "chinese_context",
      "question": "是否在中国情境下开展？",
      "column_name": "中国情境"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "consumer_focus",
      "question": "是否与消费者行为相关？",
      "column_name": "消费者行为"
    }}
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    {{
      "key": "main_findings",
      "question": "研究的主要发现是什么？",
      "column_name": "主要发现"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "theoretical_framework",
      "question": "使用了什么理论框架？",
      "column_name": "理论框架"
    }}
  ]
}}

Input (English):
"I need to screen empirical studies about machine learning applications. I want to know if they use deep learning, whether they have benchmarks, and what datasets they use."

Output:
{{
  "mode_key": "ml_application_empirical",
  "description": "Machine learning application studies screening",
  "yes_no_questions": [
    {{
      "key": "is_empirical",
      "question": "Is this an empirical study?",
      "column_name": "Empirical Study"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "uses_deep_learning",
      "question": "Does it use deep learning methods?",
      "column_name": "Deep Learning"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "has_benchmarks",
      "question": "Does it include benchmark comparisons?",
      "column_name": "Has Benchmarks"
    }}
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    {{
      "key": "datasets_used",
      "question": "What datasets are used in the study?",
      "column_name": "Datasets"
    }},
    {{
      "key": "ml_methods",
      "question": "What machine learning methods are employed?",
      "column_name": "ML Methods"
    }}
  ]
}}

Now generate the configuration for the user's requirements above.
