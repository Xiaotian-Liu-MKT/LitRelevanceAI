You are an expert in academic literature screening and research methodology.

The user wants to create a literature screening mode with the following requirements:

"""
{user_description}
"""

Please generate a screening mode configuration in JSON format with this exact structure:

{
  "mode_key": "descriptive_key_in_snake_case",
  "description": "Brief description in {language}",
  "yes_no_questions": [
    {"key": "english_key", "question": "Question text in {language}?", "column_name": "Column in {language}"}
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    {"key": "english_key", "question": "Question text in {language}?", "column_name": "Column in {language}"}
  ]
}

Guidelines:
1. Use yes/no questions for binary judgments
2. Use open questions for descriptive or extractive information
3. Keys must be in English snake_case (e.g., sample_size)
4. Questions and column names must be in {language}
5. 3-6 yes/no questions, 2-4 open questions
6. Output ONLY JSON. No markdown, no explanations
