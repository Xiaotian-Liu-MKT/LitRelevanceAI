# AGENTS

## Development
- Install dependencies with `python -m pip install -e .`.
- Run `litrx --help` to ensure the command line interface loads.
- Run `pytest` before committing.

## Conventions
- Prefer `rg` for searching the repository.
- Keep documentation in both `README.md` and `Chinese_README.md` up to date with any CLI or packaging changes.
